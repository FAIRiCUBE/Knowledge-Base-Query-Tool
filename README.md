# FAIRiCUBE Knowledge Base  Query Tool

This repository is intended for sharing our current understanding and getting feedback on the proposed architecture, structure and functionalities of the Knowledge Base (KB) Query Tool as well as related look &amp; feel.  Comments and issues related to the Query Tool shall be provided via issue tracker of this repository

Scope
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Query Tool enables interactive searches over the project's analysis and processing resources, based on different levels of technical expertise. This tool can be used to discover and analyse the processing resources of the use cases and their assets (datasets, pre-trained models, code libraries …) through the accurate descriptions contained in the related metadata. 

Structure of the KB Query Tool
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Governance of the Query Tool content:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the project lifetime:
- EPSIT provides for web page static content. 
- Regarding the partners’contributions: 
  - Documentation of a/p resources (algorithms, pipelines, preprocessing etc) shall be provided through related a/p metadata. This happens through a dedicated [web form](https://fairicube-md.dev.epsilon-italia.it/) accessible from the FAIRiCUBE Hub (this form will also be helpful in possible uptake from other projects e.g., easily provide authentication)

After the end of the project:
- Long-term exploitation of the Query Tool will be clearer once the long-term exploitation of the HUB has been agreed.
